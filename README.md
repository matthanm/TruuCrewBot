# TruuCrewBot

This project is an experiment in the world of internet bots, in this case, pertaining to GroupMe. This bot should provide basic textual messages to a group. Perhaps in time, it could evolve into something else. The instructions for how to set up a bot can be found [here](https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/bots). The application itself is written in Python.
